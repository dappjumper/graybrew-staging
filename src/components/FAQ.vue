<br/><br/>
But as with any coffee-based beverage, an adequate amount of caffeine goes a long way. Each bottle of Cold Brew x Gray Brew contains 250ML of concentrated coffee extract‚Äîyou best believe that caffeine kick will come in strong like a wrecking-ball if you chug the entire thing in one breath. So just take it easy, twitchy.

          'Is cold brew coffee the same as iced coffee?',
          `Quick answer: no! üôÖüèΩ‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
<br/><br/>
You can make iced coffee from cold brew, but you can‚Äôt make cold brew from iced coffee‚Ä¶ if that makes any sense? The key difference lies in the word ‚Äúbrew.‚Äù Cold brew coffee means the coffee from the beans is extracted with room temperature water (or colder) and leaving it alone to do some black (coffee) magic for at least a good half day. It‚Äôs a slow and sexy process but that‚Äôs how we get liquid gold in a bottle for you to enjoy how you drink your coffee.
<br/><br/>
And one of those ways is iced coffee, which is basically pouring an already prepared coffee drink from either cold-brewed or hot-brewed coffee over ice. Remember: Cold brew is a brewing method while iced coffee is how your drink is served.

          'What‚Äôs the fuss about cold brew coffee?',
          `It‚Äôs less acidic, for a start. You know how sometimes when you drink hot-brewed coffee in the morning and your tummy goes ouchie?
          <br/>We don‚Äôt want that‚Äîwe‚Äôll never hurt you, baby.<br/><br/>Cold brew coffee can be 60% less acidic because it‚Äôs a less aggressive way of bringing out coffee from the beans compared to using hot water. Coffee beans are tiny delicate flavor-bombs, and it‚Äôs our pleasure to make time to give you coffee that‚Äôs less acidic, less bitter, and overall smoother, full-bodied coffee experience that‚Äôs better for your stomach (and teeth üòÅ).

          'Because it‚Äôs cold brew, does it mean I can never drink my coffee hot again?',
          'No, you silly goose. With cold brew, the only limit is your imagination, not the temperature of your drink.<br/><br/>Because the unadulterated coffee essence is bottled for your drinking enjoyment, you are now free to enjoy your coffee to your heart‚Äôs desire. Just pour about a third of the bottle as your main coffee base then fill your cup with water‚Äîhot, boiling, lukewarm, ice-cold, or what have you, you‚Äôre no longer shackled to the societal coffee-drinking norms!  <br/><br/>And who says you‚Äôre limited only with water? Legend has it‚Ä¶ milk, cream, ice cream, or even coconut milk all go well with the rich coffee taste of Gray Brew Coffee.<br/><br/>If you like your coffee as sweet as you are, sweeteners like sugar, honey, or even condensed milk are known to bring out the sweetness of cold brew coffee. Really, at this point, we‚Äôre more interested with the creative ways you enjoy your coffee!'

The difference lies with our process, which falls nothing short of high quality cold brewing.<br/><br/>Needless to say, we do our very best to treat our coffee right which helps bring out the best flavor each coffee bean has in store.'

Or, the next time you order, you can give the rinsed bottles back to our delivery crew or drop them off at our locations in Manila or Makati. We‚Äôll then take care of recycling.
